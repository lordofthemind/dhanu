A well-organized project structure is key to managing complexity as the **Dhanu** CLI tool grows. Below is a recommended **Golang project structure** for your **Dhanu** project, based on the modular development plan.

### **Expected Project Structure:**

```bash
dhanu/                 # Root directory of the Dhanu project
├── cmd/               # All Cobra commands for CLI
│   ├── root.go        # The root command (entry point for the CLI)
│   ├── send.go        # 'send' command - handles sending emails
│   ├── run.go         # 'run' command - runs scripts and emails output
│   ├── watch.go       # 'watch' command - watches files for changes
│   ├── config.go      # 'config' command - handles config management
│   ├── logs.go        # 'logs' command - for viewing logs
│   └── version.go     # 'version' command - for showing version
│
├── pkg/               # Internal reusable packages (library code)
│   ├── email/         # Email sending logic
│   │   ├── email.go   # Functions for sending emails
│   │   └── template.go# Email templating support

│   └── utils/         # Utilities like compression, file handling, etc.
│       ├── compress.go# Functions for file compression
│       └── exec.go    # Functions for script execution
│
├── internal/          # Internal application logic (helpers)
│   ├── mailer/        # Abstraction for email services (SMTP, etc.)
│   └── watcher/       # File watcher logic
│
├── config/            # Configuration files
│   ├── config.yaml    # Default config file (e.g., SMTP details)
│   └── credentials.env# Env file for sensitive information
│
├── logs/              # Log files directory
│   └── dhanu.log      # Log file for the application
│
├── test/              # Test files and test data
│   ├── email_test.go  # Unit tests for email functionality
│   ├── config_test.go # Unit tests for configuration
│   └── utils_test.go  # Unit tests for utilities
│
├── .env               # Environment file (not committed to source control)
├── .gitignore         # Git ignore file
├── README.md          # Project documentation
├── LICENSE            # License file
└── main.go            # Main entry point of the application
```

### **Explanation of Key Directories/Files:**

1. **`cmd/`**:
   - This directory holds all Cobra-based commands. Each feature like sending emails (`send.go`), running scripts (`run.go`), watching files (`watch.go`), and others will have a dedicated command file.

2. **`pkg/`**:
   - **`email/`**: Contains functions to handle email sending, attachment handling, and templates.
   - **`config/`**: Manages configuration loading (from files or environment variables) using Viper.
   - **`logger/`**: Handles logging of events, email sends, and errors.
   - **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions for tasks like file compression and script execution.

3. **`internal/`**:
   - **`mailer/`**: Abstracts the actual email services (e.g., SMTP, or future integrations like SendGrid).
   - **`watcher/`**: File-watching logic that triggers emails on file changes.

4. **`config/`**:
   - Stores configuration files like `config.yaml` for default settings and an optional `.env` file for credentials like SMTP login.

5. **`logs/`**:
   - Directory for log files where email send attempts, errors, and other operational logs will be stored.

6. **`test/`**:
   - Contains all unit tests for various modules. You'll write tests for the `email`, `config`, and `utils` functionalities here.

7. **`main.go`**:
   - The entry point for the program. This file initializes the root command from Cobra and kicks off the CLI tool.

8. **`.gitignore`**:
   - Includes files and directories that should be excluded from version control, such as logs, `.env`, and build artifacts.

9. **`README.md`**:
   - This file contains documentation for the project, installation instructions, and usage examples.

### **Suggested Steps for Implementation:**

1. **Start with the CLI (`cmd/` folder)**: 
   - Initialize the root command and add the basic `send`, `run`, and `watch` commands.

2. **Develop core logic in `pkg/`**:
   - Implement the core logic for sending emails (`email/`), handling configurations (`config/`), and utility functions (`utils/`).

3. **Add internal logic for file watching and mailing**:
   - Start implementing file-watcher logic and a mailer abstraction for managing emails across services.

4. **Focus on logging and error handling**:
   - Add comprehensive logging to record email attempts, script executions, and file-watching events.

5. **Testing**:
   - Begin writing unit tests for each module, ensuring test coverage for all critical components.

This structure is designed to promote clean code separation, reusability, and ease of testing. It will scale well as more features are added.
