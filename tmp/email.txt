Here are the limits for Gmail:

Attachment Size Limit:

Gmail allows up to 25 MB per email, including attachments.
If you need to send files larger than 25 MB, Gmail will automatically upload the file to Google Drive and insert a link to the file in the email.
Word Limit in Email Body:

Gmail does not have a strict word limit for the email body, but the total email size (including attachments, text, formatting, and metadata) is limited to 25 MB. The email body would need to remain within this total size.
Subject Line Limit:

The subject line is limited to 78 characters. While this is not strictly a word limit, it effectively limits how much you can write in the subject.
